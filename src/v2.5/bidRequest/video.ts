/**
 * This object represents an in-stream video impression.
 * Many of the fields are non-essential for minimally viable transactions, but are included to offer fine control when needed.
 * Video in OpenRTB generally assumes compliance with the VAST standard.
 * As such, the notion of companion ads is supported by optionally including an array of Banner objects (refer to the Banner object in Section 3.2.6) that define these companion ads.
 * 
 * The presence of a Video as a subordinate of the Imp object indicates that this impression is offered as a video type impression.
 * At the publisherâ€™s discretion, that same impression may also be offered as banner, audio, and/or native by also including as Imp subordinates objects of those types.
 * However, any given bid for the impression must conform to one of the offered types.
