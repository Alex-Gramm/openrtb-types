 * This object is the top-level bid response object (i.e., the unnamed outer JSON object).

 * Similarly, bidid is an optional response tracking ID for bidders.

 * At least one seatbid object is required, which contains at least one bid for an impression.
 * Other attributes are optional.

 * To express a "no-bid", the options are to return an empty response with HTTP 204.
 * Alternately if the bidder wishes to convey to the exchange a reason for not bidding, just a BidResponse object is returned with a reason code in the nbr attribute.
